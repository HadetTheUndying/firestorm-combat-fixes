# firestorm-combat-fixes
A collection of configuration modifications.

**Fixing the Teleport Failed Alert Notifications:**

On Windows copy the notifcations.xml file to this directory:

`C:\Program Files\Firestorm-Releasex64\skins\default\xui\en\`

On Linux if you kept the default user install path:

`~/firestorm/skins/default/xui/en`

The other file is for a somewhat up-to-date version of the contact sets we pass around.

Place it inside this directory.


Windows:

`C:\Users\YOURPCUSERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Firestorm_x64\YOUR_AVATAR\`

Linux:

`~/.firestorm_x64/your_avatar/`
